<h1 align="center">Contact Manager Laravel + React: (Full Stack)</h1>

### Overview:

<p align="justify">My project is a user input application that allows users to input their personal information, including their first name, last name, address, contact number, email address, and user image. The app includes form validation with Laravel, which ensures that all user input is correct and meets the required format. In addition, SweetAlert is used to display user-friendly messages to the user when a form is submitted or when there is an error.</p>

### Features:
<p>The app includes the following features:</P>

<ul>
  <li>Input forms for user information, including first name, last name, address, contact number, email address, and user image</li>
  <li>Display of user information in a user profile</li>
  <li>Ability to edit and update user information as needed</li>
  <li>Search functionality for finding users by name</li>
  <li>Form validation with Laravel to ensure that all user input is correct and meets the required format</li>
  <li>SweetAlert message to display user-friendly messages to the user when a form is submitted or when there is an error.</li>
</ul>

### Technology stack:
<p>The app is built using the following technologies:</P>

<ul>
  <li>React js as the frontend framework</li>
  <li>Laravel 10 as the backend framework</li>
  <li>MySQL as the database management system</li>
  <li>Bootstrap as the CSS framework</li>
  <li>Laravel Validation for form validation</li>
  <li>SweetAlert for displaying user-friendly messages</li>
 </ul>
 
 ### Walkthrough:
 
 <p>Users can input their personal information, including their first name, last name, address, contact number, email address, and user image, using the input forms provided. When a user submits a form, the app uses Laravel validation to ensure that all input is correct and meets the required format. If there is an error, SweetAlert is used to display a user-friendly error message. When a form is successfully submitted, SweetAlert is used to display a user-friendly success message. Once the user information is submitted, it is stored in a centralized database that can be accessed and updated as needed. The app also includes a search function that allows users to find other users by name or contact information.</li>
 
 ### Challenges:
 
 <p>One of the challenges I faced during the development of this project was implementing form validation and error messages. I overcame this challenge by using Laravel validation to ensure that all input met the required format, and using SweetAlert to display user-friendly error and success messages.</li>
 
 ### Summary:
 
 <p>Overall, my user input application built with Laravel allows users to input and store their personal information in a centralized database. The app includes features such as user input forms, display of user information in a user profile, and the ability to update and search for user information. The use of Laravel validation and SweetAlert also ensures that all user input is correct and provides user-friendly error and success messages. I hope to continue improving this app and incorporating new features in the future.</p>
